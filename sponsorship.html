        CWRUbotix creates robots that solve challenging and relevant problems. In pursuing this objective, it provides the student body with opportunities to learn concepts beyond their curriculum, to gain real world experience in leadership, project management, robotics and related fields, and to promote STEM and robotics education within the local community.
  	  </p>
  	  <p>
  	    Our core team is currently composed of 60 students, and membership is open to all CWRU students. We currently participate in our projects, events, and competitions. But we can't do it alone. We rely on community members, local professionals, alumni, businesses, and other students to support our mission through volunteering, mentorship, and sponsorship.

        <h2>Mentorship</h2>
        <p>
          As a team and as students, we do everything we can to broaden our knowledge and skills, so that we can build better robots and be better roboteers. Sometimes we bring in professionals in a field so that we can learn from them. If you are a professional in an engineering or software field interested in mentoring our team, even as a one-time event, please contact us using <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/2PNFcmoelwugzRcQ2">this form</a>.
